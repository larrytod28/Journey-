# I Can Build Systems, I Can Protect Systems, I Can Break Systems

Hi, I’m [Your Name / Alias]. I’ve spent my life **building, protecting, and testing systems** — now I’m turning that experience into a career in **cybersecurity and platform engineering**.

---

## 🌐 My Mantra
- **Build Systems** – Platform engineering, automation, IaC, Kubernetes, CI/CD  
- **Protect Systems** – Security monitoring, SOC operations, vulnerability management  
- **Break Systems** – Penetration testing, ethical hacking, offensive security

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
1. **SOC Analyst / Defensive Security**  
   - Studying **CompTIA CySA+**  
   - Practicing with TryHackMe SOC Labs  
   - Building security monitoring projects (SIEM, alert dashboards)

2. **Penetration Testing**  
   - Preparing for **eJPT**  
   - Hands-on labs: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, VulnHub  
   - Documenting writeups in public repos

3. **Platform Engineering / Infrastructure**  
   - Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines  
   - Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)  
   - Security-first DevOps (policies as code, secrets management)

## 🛠 Skills
- **Cloud & IaC:** AWS, Terraform, Pulumi, Docker, Kubernetes  
- **CI/CD & Automation:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Security:** SOC monitoring, CySA+, eJPT labs, vulnerability scanning  
- **Observability & DevOps:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, logging, observability

✅ **Why this works**

* Opens with your mantra — immediately memorable
* Highlights **three distinct skill pillars**
* Links to repos show tangible proof
* Roadmap signals growth, ambition, and direction
